Homework

Employee System

This homework is to create a system to store employee and department details.

Each employee has a Name, Salary and Department. Each Department has a name.

You will be given starter code with an SQL Runner and template classes for Employee and Department.

We will not be looking for tests at the moment just for the functions to print out to screen.

You will notice that salary is a real in sql file and double in java file.

To interpolate a double into string use %7.2f (instead of %d)

Extensions
